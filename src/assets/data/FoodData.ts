As the first restaurant in Japan to achieve 3 Michelin stars, a popular documentary film further catapulted the restaurant to larger-than-life stardom, to the point that scoring a seat became such a daunting task, that it stopped appearing on the popular guide as of 2020. But the legendary location quickly returned to the guide¬¥s pages with none other than 2 stars, under a different branch opened in Tokyo¬¥s upscale Roppongi district. Helmed by Jiro Ono¬¥s second son Takashi Ono, this address stays on brand with the same exceptional quality that made its predecessor a worldwide celebrity.",

After all, his training took place at the aforementioned Sukibayashi Jiro, so it surprises no one that the skills displayed at his own restaurant have resulted in two Michelin stars for Harutaka. Experiencing the complexity of taste and texture of the most authentic sushi, Chef Takahashi elevates sushi to an art form. Diners at the counter are surrounded by a minimalist yet warm ambiance and have the unique experience of watching the chef prepare each piece in front of them.",
