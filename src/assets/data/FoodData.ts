    info: "A legend among sushi legends, Sukibayashi Jiro (すきやばし次郎) plays in a league of his own. As the first restaurant in Japan to achieve 3 Michelin stars, a popular documentary film further catapulted the restaurant to larger-than-life stardom, to the point that scoring a seat became such a daunting task, that it stopped appearing on the popular guide as of 2020. But the legendary name quickly returned to the guide´s pages with none other than 2 stars, under a different branch opened in Tokyo´s upscale Roppongi district. Helmed by Jiro Ono´s second son Takashi Ono, this location stays on brand with the same exceptional quality that made its predecessor a worldwide celebrity. ",

Experiencing the complexity of taste and texture of the most authentic sushi, Chef Takahashi elevates sushi to an art form. Diners at the counter are surrounded by a minimalist yet warm ambiance and have the unique experience of watching the chef prepare each piece in front of them.",
